## 🔄 Standard Workflow

### **1. Local Development**

```bash
# Start dev server
cd ~/Desktop/brosham-nest
npm run dev

# Make your changes
# Test locally at http://localhost:8080
```

### **2. Commit to Git**

```bash
# Check changes
git status

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "feat: Your feature description"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### **3. Staging Auto-Deploys**

- Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
- Check: `https://staging.broshamproperties.my`
- Test all changes thoroughly

### **4. Deploy to Production** (When ready)

```bash
# Build production version
cd ~/Desktop/brosham-nest
npm run build

# Create deployment package
cd dist
zip -r production-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M).zip .
```

**Then in Plesk:**
1. Backup current production (optional but recommended)
2. Delete `index.html` and `assets/` folder
3. Upload the new zip file
4. Extract it
5. Delete the zip
6. Verify `api/config.php` has production credentials
7. Test the live site

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback

If production breaks after deployment:

### **Option 1: Quick Rollback (if you have backup zip)**
1. Delete broken files
2. Upload previous working zip
3. Extract

### **Option 2: Restore from Backup**
1. Plesk → Backup Manager
2. Find latest backup
3. Restore website files

### **Option 3: Redeploy from Git**
1. Rebuild from last working commit
2. Upload manually

---

## 🛠️ Common Issues

### **Issue: 404 on page refresh**
**Solution:** Check `.htaccess` exists and has correct rewrite rules

**Solution:** Check `api/settings.php` exists and database table is created

### **Issue: Login not working**
**Solution:** Verify `api/config.php` has correct database credentials

### **Issue: API errors**
**Solution:** Check `api/config.php` credentials and database accessibility
