# 🔧 Fix Blog-Fixer 404 Error

## The Issue
The blog-fixer.html file wasn't being copied to the dist folder during build.

## ✅ Fixed!
I've updated the `copy-api.sh` script to include blog-fixer.html.

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Now:

### 1. Rebuild
```bash
cd /Users/izwanrasip/Desktop/brosham-nest

```

### 2. Push to Git
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Include blog-fixer.html in build"

```
